# Persian Car Plate Detection

## Overview

The goal of this project is to distinguish images that contain an image of car plate.

## What we've done:

- Trained multiple deep CNN models to classify images that contain car plates.
- Coded relatively complex deep models using Keras with caching support.

## Notes

- Code for implementing models (Xception, ResNet, MobileNet) is places in `notebooks` directory.
- `Scripts` directory contains codes for a custom data augmentation method and running and evaluating the saved models.
- This project is done in collaboration with [Mahsa Anvarian](https://github.com/mahsawz) as part of our Computer Vision course.
- The best project of the class, both in terms of execution time and F1 score.
