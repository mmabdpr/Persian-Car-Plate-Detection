# Persian Car Plate Detection

## Overview

The goal of this project is to distinguish images that contain an image of car plate. We implemented multiple models and used several data augmentation techniques.

## Notes

- Code for implementing models (Xception, ResNet, MobileNet) is places in `notebooks` directory.
- `Scripts` directory contains codes for a custom data augmentation method and running and evaluating the saved models.
- This project is done in collaboration with [Mahsa Anvarian](https://github.com/mahsawz).
